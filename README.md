# MCI-Visibility-Graph-ML
Code for analysis, feature selection, and classification of MCI converter data.

To get started: You need to install the python3 packages in requirements.txt. Everything is self contained in the Jupyter notebook, other than the data. If you have the data, just put the the notebook in the same directory as the folders containing the data (eg "AD_data", "MCI All New Raw Data", etc.) and run it sequentially.
